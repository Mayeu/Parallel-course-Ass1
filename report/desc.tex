\chapter{Problem description}

The goal of this assignement is to implement the multiplication of dense matrix in a parallel distributed memory environment. In the case of the assignement we only consider $n\times n$ matrix. And the matrix will be randomly generated given a size.\\

To realize the multiplication we use a partitionning strategie. Each processor will be responsable of a part (of equal size) from the original matrix. To compute the result, we will use the Fox's algorithm.

For a processor $P^{(s,r)}$ we compute:
\[C^{(s,r)} = \sum^{\sqrt{p}-1}_{k=0}A^{(s,k)}B^{(k,r)}\]
